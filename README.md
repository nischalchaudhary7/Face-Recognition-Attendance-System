The Face Recognition Attendance System is an AI-powered solution that automates student attendance tracking using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. This system employs real-time face recognition to mark attendance with a 77% accuracy threshold, ensuring reliable student identification. The project integrates MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval, allowing seamless record management. Additionally, it supports CSV import/export, enabling users to manage attendance logs conveniently.

Designed with a user-friendly graphical interface, the system features modular components including student registration, attendance monitoring, and help support, making it intuitive and efficient for users. The training module uses the LBPH Face Recognizer, ensuring robust face matching capabilities. The application captures student images, processes them into datasets, trains the model, and then recognizes faces in real-time to log attendance. The system also provides real-time reporting of attendance data, allowing users to view, update, and export records easily.

This project is structured for scalability and future improvements. Potential enhancements include integrating deep learning models to improve recognition accuracy, developing web-based or mobile applications, and incorporating RFID/NFC technology for multi-modal authentication. The Face Recognition Attendance System streamlines attendance tracking, reduces manual effort, and enhances accuracy, making it a valuable tool for educational institutions and workplaces
